Bitcoin Mastermind Save Results Light. Free addon for Bitcoin Mastermind to save basic results of quizzes

== Description ==

# Bitcoin Mastermind. The easiest way to create fun quizzes for you site

This is an addon plugin for [Bitcoin Mastermind](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hd-quiz/ "Bitcoin Mastermind") and cannot be used on its own. Bitcoin Mastermind 1.7.0+ is required.

See a live demo of [Bitcoin Mastermind in action](https://designbypixl.com/the-ultimate-friends-quiz/ "See a live demo").

This addon will create a new Results page for Bitcoin Mastermind that shows a nice table listing each time one of your quizzes was completed. The table includes the name of the completed quiz, the date and time of completion, the score, whether the quiz was passed of failed, and, if the user was logged-in, their display name.

= NOTICE ⚠️ =
